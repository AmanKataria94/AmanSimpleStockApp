# AmanSimpleStockApp

Made in VSCode but hopefully should run in intellij if set up as a project no problem.
Jar is committed so worst case use - 'java -jar target/superSimpleStock-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar'

Treated this challenge more like a game. Since no gui needed I made a small console app.

Could be ported to be a more sophisticated web app. If desired please let me know.
