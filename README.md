# AmanSimpleStockApp

Made in VSCode but hopefully should run in intellij if set up as a project no problem.
Jar is committed so worst case use - 'java -jar target/superSimpleStock-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar'

Treated this challenge more like a game. Since no gui needed I made a small console app.

Occured to me late in the project that this could be better done over a REST API. If desired to change into one to showcase my skills a bit more please let me know.
